      "# Abstract\n",
      "This document looks at how different choices of model and different choices of parameterisation can affect the perplexity of held-out data. The dataset is described in the DatasetTests PDF: it consists of approximately 580,000 tweets from over 350 users using a vocabulary of 82,000 words to come up with a corpus of roughly 5.5m words total.\n",
      "\n",
      "The setup is each configuration of each algorithm was run through a 5-fold cross-validation, with perplexity on the held out data as the metric. How perplexity was calculated depends on the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the correlated topic-models (CTM) the input was structured as an author-topic model, so there was one document with each user containing all their tweets. The result is a correlated author topic-model of tweets, which acts as a baseline. To calculate perplexity on the held out data, half the words in each document were used to determine the topic distribution, the the log-likelihood was evaluated over the other half of the words using those inferred topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the STM-YV topic-model, the input were the 580K tweets, each with associated features, the features being the author ID, the week ID and the month ID. As the topics are a function of the _features_, and not the words, there was no need to split the words of the tweets into two subsets to evaluate the likelihood: all the words were used for the evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two bounds used throughout, the Bouchard bound and the Bohning bound. Both are quadratic bounds."
